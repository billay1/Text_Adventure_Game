# Text_Adventure_Game
Python - I created a text game based on the story Puss in Booths. In the game, you will have a series of riddles or logic questions to answer in order to pass 
and arrive at the end of the Game. I constructed this game 2 weeks after my python class started and has been very helpful to learn the language.
